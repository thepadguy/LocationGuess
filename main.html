                <p class="modalText"></p>&emsp;LocationGuessr is a game based on <a
                    href="https://www.geoguessr.com">GeoGuessr</a>
                but with a twist. In LocationGuessr you are given the coordinates of a random place in the globe
                along with a static map of that place (upper left map) and you are tasked with finding this place
                on a world map (lower right map). You can drag and zoom the bottom right map and you can click
                on it to place a pin wherever you believe the forementioned place is. If you want to change
                your pin's position simply click another place on the map (only one pin can be on the map).
                When you are certain use the "GUESS" button to check your answer. A panel will appear containing
                information
                about your guess and your distance from the target and simultaneously a pin on the target coordinates
                will be
                placed on the map that is now centered on it. To play again (or to skip a level) use the "NEXT LEVEL"
                button.
                <br>
                &emsp;Please note that the static map may take a while to load depending on your (necessary) internet
                connection.
                There is also the chance that instead of an image it displays "Sorry there are no images available" or
                just a grey
                area (which is no problem if the target is snowy since that is the normal thing to be displayed). This
                mostly happens
                when the target is on the Arctic Ocean or any other ocean. While I have tried and succeeded to minimize
                this issue
                as much as possible I cannot say for certain that it won't happen to you, so I humbly ask for your
                understanding and
                patience. The best way to deal with this issue is to use the "NEXT LEVEL" button.

                &emsp;The static map displayed is an embedded <a href="https://maps.google.com">google map</a> and the interactive map is created using <a

                Also the code is inspired by <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and countless
                StackOverflow posts and the font used is

                **FAIR USE**
                <br>This site is for educational purposes only!
                <br>Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for "fair use"
                for purposes such as criticism, comment, news, reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.
                <br>Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing.
                <br>Fair use definition:
                <br>(Source: <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use</a>)
                <br>Fair use is a doctrine in United States law that permits limited use of copyrighted material without
                having to first acquire permission from the copyright holder. Fair use is one of the limitations to
                copyright intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider
                distribution and use of creative works by allowing as a defense to copyright infringement claims certain
                limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement. Unlike "fair dealing" rights that exist
                in most countries with a British legal history, the fair use right is a general exception that applies
                to all different kinds of uses with all types of works and turns on a flexible proportionality test that
                examines the purpose of the use, the amount used, and the impact on the market of the original work.
                <br>The doctrine of "fair use" originated in the Anglo-American common law during the 18th and 19th
                centuries as a way of preventing copyright law from being too rigidly applied and "stifling the very
                creativity which [copyright] law is designed to foster." Though originally a common law doctrine,
                it was enshrined in statutory law when the U.S. Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1976. The U.S.
                Supreme Court has issued several major decisions clarifying and reaffirming the fair use doctrine since
                the 1980s, most recently in the 2021 decision Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.
